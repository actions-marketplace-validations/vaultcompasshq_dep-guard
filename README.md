# dep-guard

Blocks risky dependencies at the moment they are added -- before install,
before commit, before CI.

<!-- guardrails-family: shared block, keep it identical in dep-guard, vault-guard, intent-guard and conductor -->
The Vault & Compass guardrails are three gates over an AI-assisted coding
session: [dep-guard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/dep-guard)
checks what comes in (hallucinated package names, typosquats, tampered
lockfile entries),
[vault-guard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/vault-guard) checks
what goes out (credentials about to be committed), and
[intent-guard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/intent-guard)
checks the change against what was approved (drift from a frozen intent
contract, and change budgets). Each one installs, configures and runs on its
own;
[conductor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/conductor) is the
optional umbrella that runs them from one policy file, one hook and one
report.
<!-- /guardrails-family -->

**Status: published.** [`@vaultcompass/dep-guard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/dep-guard)
is on npm, covered by 1234 tests, and works out of the box: the package
name corpus ships inside
[`@vaultcompass/dep-guard-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaultcompass/dep-guard-core),
so a scan needs no `--corpus-dir` and no setup. Building your own corpus
stays possible; see [Building a corpus](#building-a-corpus).

## Why

Coding agents write dependency changes straight into `package.json` and
lockfiles. Nobody runs `npm install` and reads the output any more, which
removes the last human checkpoint that used to catch a bad name.

Attackers noticed. Models hallucinate package names at a few percent, and
roughly two in five hallucinated names repeat across identical prompts, so
they are predictable enough to register in advance. In January 2026 a
registered hallucinated name reached 237 repositories through
agent-generated files, with automated fetches starting within days.

The tools that gate installs sit after the point where this lands. dep-guard
reads the dependency diff -- or answers a proposed addition over MCP -- and
scores it before anything is fetched.

## What it checks

Six rules, all offline and deterministic (plus three optional online checks
-- see below):

- **Unknown package** -- a new name absent from a corpus of real npm package
  names. The hallucination signal.
- **Typosquat** -- edit distance against a popularity list, plus transform
  rules that catch what distance misses: separator swaps, scope flattening
  (`babel-core` against `@babel/core`), repeated and omitted characters,
  keyboard adjacency, and a curated list of known confusion pairs.
- **Install script** -- a dependency that gains the ability to run install
  scripts. Acquisition only: a version bump of a package that already ran
  them is not a finding, or every `npm update` would be noise.
- **Lockfile tamper** -- resolutions moving to another host, integrity
  hashes removed, forged, or downgraded to a weaker algorithm, and tarballs
  repointed within the same host. It also reads the declared specifier, so a
  dependency pointed at a git or url source instead of the registry is
  reported even in a repository whose lockfile format this tool cannot
  parse. Any revision that MOVES a dependency to a git or url source blocks
  at `critical`, pinned to a commit or not: an attacker's fork pinned to a
  commit is still an attacker's fork. The one softened case is a scan with
  no earlier revision to compare against, where every dependency reads as
  newly added whether or not it is. There, a git source already pinned to a
  full commit SHA reports at `low`, because it cannot change under you and
  blocking it would refuse the first commit of every repository that has
  one. A mutable ref still blocks even in that mode, since what it installs
  can change without your manifest changing.
- **Version hygiene** -- wildcard and `latest` specifiers on new
  dependencies. Demoted rather than exempted on `@types/*` packages: a
  DefinitelyTyped package ships no runtime code, so an unpinned range on one
  cannot hand an attacker code that executes, but it stays visible and
  `install-script` still covers the residual risk of its own install
  scripts.
- **Dependency confusion** -- a scope pinned to a private registry that
  resolves from the public one, and internal names arriving from outside.

Findings carry a severity and a stable fingerprint. A fingerprint survives
version bumps and corpus refreshes, so a baseline you accept today keeps
working tomorrow.

**A known limitation in this release:** typosquat's curated confusion pairs
(the 48 documented registry incidents, plus anything you add via
`extraAliases`) block at the default threshold, as they always have.
Everything else the check reports -- separator swaps, scope flattening,
repeated or transposed characters, keyboard adjacency, and edit distance --
is resemblance rather than a known confusion, and measuring it against nine
well maintained public repositories found three findings, all of them false
positives, and zero true positives. So for now those matches report at
`low`: visible if you scan at `--fail-on low`, but out of the default gate.
Lowering your own threshold to `low` or below re-enables them as blocking.
This is exactly what `--online` now addresses: turned on, a non-alias-list
match escalates from `low` to `high` once the candidate's own weekly
downloads confirm it is genuinely unpopular, not merely smaller than an
extremely popular target -- see below.

## Online checks (`--online`)

Off by default, permanently -- this tool reads manifests and lockfiles
offline by design, and network calls do not belong in a hook or an MCP
propose-time check that has to answer fast. Turn `--online` on for CI or a
scheduled audit, where the latency cost is irrelevant. The flag turns them
on for one run; `"online": true` in `.dep-guard.json` turns them on for
every invocation, pre-commit hooks included, which is why a
latency-sensitive setup is usually better off passing `--online` in CI
alone.

Three checks, all backed by npm's public downloads and registry metadata
APIs, all degrading to the offline result with a diagnostic on any network
failure rather than blocking:

- **Unknown package resolution.** The offline unknown-package rule answers
  from a corpus built on one dated registry walk, so every package
  published after that walk reads as unknown to that release, forever.
  `--online` asks the registry directly. If the name really exists, the
  unknown-package finding is **downgraded to `low`** rather than removed:
  `low` is below the default gate, so it stops blocking, but it stays in
  the report so you can still see that dep-guard looked at the name and
  what it concluded. That matters for one case in particular: a name
  registered after the corpus walk but more than thirty days ago falls
  outside registered-squat's age window, so this `low` finding is the only
  thing dep-guard says about it. The downgrade asserts only that the name
  exists; typosquat and registered-squat still judge whether it is
  *suspicious*, which is the question that actually matters. If the
  registry answers 404, the finding escalates from `high` to `critical`,
  because the innocent explanation the offline message offers ("published
  after that date") has just been ruled out. A 200 is not automatically
  taken as existence: a name whose versions have all been unpublished, or
  one npm has seized and replaced with a `0.0.1-security` placeholder,
  keeps its `high` finding, since npm taking a name over is not evidence
  the name is safe. Anything else -- a timeout, a server error, a spent
  budget -- leaves the finding exactly as the offline scan made it, still
  blocking, with the reason recorded in its `details`. A network failure
  never means fewer or quieter findings. Names in your configured
  `internalScopes` or `internalPrefixes` are never sent to the registry at
  all.
- **Typosquat popularity asymmetry.** Escalates a non-alias-list typosquat
  match from `low` to `high` when the candidate's own weekly downloads sit
  below a measured floor of two thousand downloads in the last week --
  confirming the match is not just a name that resembles something popular,
  but a package genuinely nobody uses.
- **Registered squat.** A new, `medium`-severity finding for a dependency
  published within the last thirty days with fewer than fifty downloads in
  the last week. This exists because the offline existence check reads a
  corpus snapshot: a name registered by an attacker, then absorbed by a
  later corpus refresh, reads as "known" forever afterward. This check has
  no resemblance filter to narrow its candidates the way typosquat's does,
  so it is deliberately conservative (both signals required, not either
  alone) and reports below `high` -- it carries the same false-positive
  risk the offline existence check has: a legitimately brand-new package
  looks identical to a squat by age and downloads alone.

All three share one wall-clock budget of twenty seconds per run, not per
request. Once it is spent the remaining lookups are skipped, the affected
findings keep exactly the result the offline checks gave them, and an
`online-deadline-exceeded` diagnostic says how many were skipped. Without
it, a repository adding twenty new names could stall a commit for
half a minute while every individual request stayed comfortably inside
its own timeout.

`--no-online` forces the online checks off for one run, overriding
`"online": true` in `.dep-guard.json`. That is the flag to reach for in a
pre-commit hook or an air-gapped build in a repository whose committed
config turns them on.

## Installing the pre-commit hook (`dep-guard init`)

```
dep-guard init                        # .git/hooks/pre-commit
dep-guard init --manager husky        # .husky/pre-commit
dep-guard init --manager lefthook     # lefthook-local.yml
dep-guard init --manager precommit    # .pre-commit-config.yaml
dep-guard init --dry-run              # print what would be written
```

The hook runs `dep-guard scan --staged` on every commit. It is safe to
re-run: a second `init` reports the hook is already installed and changes
nothing. It never overwrites a hook it did not write -- if one is already
there, init stops and tells you what to merge in by hand.

A bare `dep-guard init` detects a husky-managed repository on its own: if
`core.hooksPath` points at husky 9's generated `.husky/_` directory, init
installs into the tracked `.husky/pre-commit` file instead, since anything
written under `.husky/_` is regenerated by husky's own install step and
would otherwise vanish on the next `pnpm install`. `--manager husky` is
never required for this.

The generated hook is deliberately **fail-closed**: if the `dep-guard`
binary is not on `PATH`, the commit is blocked with a one-line message
rather than waved through. A gate that switches itself off when the tool
is missing is a gate an attacker turns off by making the tool missing. It
also passes dep-guard's own exit code straight through, so exit 2 ("could
not run the checks") stays distinguishable from exit 1 ("blocking
findings"), which are different facts.

Under `lefthook` and the `pre-commit` framework, those managers own the
hook's exit code themselves. A non-zero dep-guard still blocks the commit,
but the difference between its 1 and its 2 does not survive into the exit
code the manager reports.

**To uninstall,** delete the file init wrote -- the path is printed when
it installs, and `--dry-run` will tell you again. For `lefthook` and
`pre-commit`, delete the file or just remove the `dep-guard` stanza if you
have added your own hooks to it. There is no `init --revert`; one file is
not worth a command that could delete the wrong thing.

## GitHub Action

`action.yml` at the root of this repository is a composite action that
runs dep-guard and uploads the result to GitHub code scanning as SARIF.

The action installs the scanner with `--ignore-scripts`, so nothing in the
resolved tree runs code on your runner at install time, and then runs
`npm audit signatures` over what it installed.

**What that verification proves, and what it does not.** It asks the registry
for each name and version in the tree, the scanner included, and checks the
signature served back, so an unpublished, replaced or unsigned package fails
the step. It does **not** read the installed files, so it will not detect a
tampered install. It does **not** defeat a compromised registry, which signs
what it serves. And a **missing** attestation is not a failure, so it does not
require provenance even though this package publishes it.

> **Two ways this step fails closed, both on purpose.**
>
> It needs **npm 10.5.2 or newer**. Below that, npm reports a clean install of
> these packages as tampered with, because its own bundled keys are stale
> rather than because anything is wrong. The action refuses up front and names
> the npm it found. `node-version: 22` is not on its own enough: Node
> **22.0.0 ships npm 10.5.1**, one patch below the floor. Node 20.13.0 and
> later, and 22.1.0 and later, carry a usable npm.
>

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    with:
      # Required on pull_request runs: pull-request mode reads the config
      # and the baseline from the base branch, which a shallow checkout
      # does not have.

  - uses: vaultcompasshq/dep-guard@v0.6.4
    with:
      path: .
      online: 'true'
      fail-on: high
```

No `version` input in that example, because the default is the scanner version
this action tag shipped with. Leaving it out is the recommended shape: the
action tag then decides the scanner, and there is one pin to bump instead of
two that can disagree.

**The action tag and the scanner version are separate numbers, and they do not
have to match.** `vaultcompasshq/dep-guard@v0.6.4` installs
`@vaultcompass/dep-guard@0.6.0`, because that release changed the action and
nothing in the scanner, so there was no new scanner to publish. Read the action
tag as "which version of the workflow step", not as "which version of the
scanner". The `version` default is always the scanner that tag was tested
against, which is the other reason to leave the input out.

Inputs: `path` (default `.`), `online` (`true`/`false`, default `false`),
`fail-on` (`critical|high|medium|low|none`, unset means dep-guard's own
default), plus `version` (an EXACT version, default the one the action
shipped with), `trust-base` (see below), `sarif-output` (default
`dep-guard-results.sarif`), and `upload-sarif` (set `false` to write the
file without uploading it, for a repository that does not have code
scanning enabled).

The SARIF is uploaded *before* the run is failed, so a scan that found
something still gets its findings into code scanning. `security-events:
write` is required for the upload; `actions/checkout` must run first.

### Where the scanner comes from

The action installs `@vaultcompass/dep-guard` from the registry into a prefix
under the runner temp and calls that copy by absolute path. It never runs the
checkout's own `node_modules`, and never starts npm with the checkout as its
working directory, so neither a committed `.npmrc` nor a package the head's
lockfile put in `node_modules` can decide which program does the scanning.

`version` no longer accepts a dist-tag, and no longer defaults to `latest`.
Two reasons. A tag means the scanner judging a pull request is whichever one
the registry served that morning rather than one decided in the workflow file.
And npm reads a value beginning with a dot, or ending in `.tgz`, as a PATH
rather than a version, which on a run that started inside the checkout was one
committed file away from the tree handing over its own scanner. **If you were
relying on the old `latest` default, pin an exact version now**; a dist-tag is
refused with a message saying so.

**On a pull request, `version` may not pin BACKWARD.** The shape check above
proves the value names a version and says nothing about which one, so every
published version clears it, and nine are published (0.1.0 through 0.6.0).
What stops a backward pin today is not that check but a flag: `--trust-base`
arrived in the 0.6.0 scanner, the run step appends it on every pull-request run
with no opt-out, and a scanner at or below 0.5.0 answers `error: unknown option
'--trust-base'`. So such a pin already fails the job, at the scan, with a
message about an unknown option instead of about the pin. This rule moves the
failure up to the validate step and names the cause. On a same-repo
`pull_request` event GitHub runs the workflow file from the pull request HEAD,
so the `version:` input is written by the pull request being judged: the day a
newer scanner ships with new rules, a pull request pins the old one and is
judged by the rule set it chose for itself. That is the same hole `trust-base: off` was refused
for, except that deleting a security step reads as deleting a security step
while a version pin reads as version management.

**So on a pull-request event the Action refuses a `version` below the scanner
the tag ships, and accepts anything at or above it.** Pinning forward is still
allowed there, on an assumption the rule does not enforce: that a newer scanner
is at least as strict. Nothing bounds a forward pin. The comparison is against
a constant in `action.yml`, which comes from the ref your workflow's `uses:`
names rather than from the pull request's tree. That holds when your workflow
names this action by owner and ref; if it names a LOCAL PATH instead, the
`./some/dir` form, `action.yml` is read out of the pull request's own tree, so
the constant is author-controlled there and this rule protects nothing.
Self-testing workflows inside this repository are the usual reason to
reference it that way.

The rule fires exactly where `GITHUB_BASE_REF` is set, which is `pull_request`
and `pull_request_target`. Push runs are out of scope. That is a statement of
scope, not a safety argument: a push to an unprotected branch runs that
branch's own workflow file, written by the same author, so it is as
author-controlled as a pull request and is not covered.

The refusal names both numbers and the fix, which is to **remove the `version`
input**. What it costs: nine scanners are published, so a workflow pinning any
of `0.1.0` through `0.5.0` passes the shape check on a pull request today and
is refused by this rule. Such a pin is already broken on that event, since
those scanners do not know `--trust-base`; the change is that the job fails at
the validate step with a message saying why. **Remove the `version` input, or
raise it to `0.6.0` or newer.**

**What it does not cover, and what it costs on forks.** A fork's
`pull_request` run uses the base repository's workflow file, so a fork author
never writes the `version:` that judges them and there is no hole there to
close. The rule still fires on that run: `GITHUB_BASE_REF` is set on a fork
pull request too, so the check runs and judges your own trusted workflow file.
A backward pin you deliberately wrote in the base workflow will fail every fork
pull request, which is a refusal on a pin nobody untrusted wrote. If you need
that pin, remove the `version:` input or raise it.

What this does not cover either is the workflow file itself, which a pull
request can edit like any other CI step: it does not stop a pull request
deleting the step, or moving the `uses:` pin to an older Action tag. Branch
protection on the base branch, with review required for `.github/workflows/**`,
is the control for that.

`bench/action-install.mjs` proves the install boundary above against real npm:
a committed `.npmrc` and a planted `node_modules` copy, run against two local
registries and the pre-fix `action.yml` from tag `v0.6.0` as a negative
control. `pnpm bench:action-install` runs it and exits non-zero on any drift
from the recorded baseline; `pnpm bench:action-install:update-baseline`
re-records it after a deliberate change.

**Linux and macOS runners.** The installed binary is called at
`<prefix>/bin/dep-guard`, which is where a global npm install puts its shims on
those two. Windows puts them in the prefix directory itself, so the path would
not exist and the job would fail as could-not-run.

## Pull-request mode (`--trust-base`)

**On a pull-request run dep-guard takes every control input from the base
ref, and the head tree is the thing being judged.**

Without that rule a pull request can turn the gate off in the same commit
that carries what the gate exists to catch. `.dep-guard.json`,
`.dep-guard.local.json`, `.dep-guard.baseline.json` and `.npmrc` all live
in the tree under judgment, so one commit could add a hallucinated
dependency and, in the same diff, add its name to `allow`, add its manifest
to `ignorePaths`, raise `failOn` above the finding's severity, or write the
finding's own fingerprint into the baseline. Every one of those exits 0
today.

`.npmrc` belongs on that list for a reason worth spelling out, because it
is the one people miss: its scope-to-registry pins are the entire
precondition of the dependency-confusion pin-mismatch rule, which fires
only for a scope that *has* a pin. So a pull request that adds
`@scope/package` resolving from the public registry **and deletes
`.npmrc`** removes the rule rather than passing it.

```
dep-guard scan --base origin/main --trust-base origin/main
```

The config, the baseline and the `.npmrc` pins are read from `<ref>` with
`git ls-tree` and `git show`. Nothing is checked out, nothing is written
into the repository. A head-side change to any of them never takes effect
for the run and is reported instead:

```
Pull-request mode: control inputs from origin/main
  config changed in this pull request (proposed: allow some-package)
  baseline changed in this pull request (1 baseline entries added)
  npmrc changed in this pull request (proposed: unpin @scope)
```

Only the scope pins are compared in `.npmrc`, not the file text, so a
rotated auth token or a changed default registry is not reported as an
attempt to loosen the gate.

A control input the head carries and the base does not reads `config added
in this pull request`, and the run uses the defaults rather than the head's
proposal. The allow counter keeps reporting what the *base* allow list
cleared, so the two lines answer two different questions: what the approved
config did, and what this change wanted instead.

`--trust-base` is not `--base`, and neither implies the other. `--base`
decides what the change is compared against; `--trust-base` decides by
whose rules it is judged. They usually name the same ref in CI, because the
base branch is both the state you diverged from and the state whose rules
were approved, but either can be passed without the other.

The gate fails closed, exit 2, with nothing scanned, when the ref does not
resolve, when it resolves to HEAD's own commit, and when it is a different
commit carrying HEAD's tree. That last one is not a hypothetical: what
GitHub publishes as `refs/pull/N/merge` is a merge commit whose tree, when
the base has not moved since the fork, *is* the head branch's tree, so
`--trust-base` pointed at the merge or head SHA would read every control
input straight back out of the tree under judgment. Pass the base *branch*.

`--format json` gains a `trustBase` block (`ref`, `proposals`,
`configChanged`, `baselineChanged`, `npmrcChanged`, `configShapeChange`,
`baselineShapeChange`, `npmrcShapeChange`), and SARIF carries each proposal as a
`toolExecutionNotification` rather than as a result, because a proposal is
a fact about the run and not a finding about the code.

Outside pull-request mode nothing changes. A pre-commit hook and a direct
CLI run on your own checkout are already inside the trust boundary, so they
never pass the flag and their output is byte for byte what it was.

### In the Action

The composite action passes the flag for you on a `pull_request` event, and
on no other event, using `origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF`. The only thing your
workflow has to do is give `actions/checkout` `fetch-depth: 0`, because the
base branch has to be present to be read. Set `trust-base` to a ref to
point pull-request mode at a different base.

There is deliberately **no value that turns pull-request mode off**, and
`trust-base: off` is refused with an error rather than quietly ignored. An
opt-out input would be settable by the pull request itself, for exactly the
reason in the next section: on a same-repository `pull_request` event the
workflow file runs from the pull request's own head. A knob the untrusted
side can turn is not a boundary, so base-ref judging is the floor rather
than a setting. If you need the old behaviour while you arrange
`fetch-depth: 0`, stay pinned to `@v0.5.0` until you have arranged it.

### Protecting the workflow file itself

One thing pull-request mode cannot do for you. On a **same-repository**
`pull_request` event the workflow file runs from the pull request's own
head, so a pull request can edit the workflow that runs the gate: delete
the step, pin the action back to a version that had no pull-request mode,
or drop `fetch-depth: 0`. Reading the control inputs from the base ref does
not help against any of those, because by then the gate was either never
invoked or never reached its own inputs.

This is also the reason `trust-base` has no opt-out value. A workflow-level
switch is reachable by a pull request on this event, so shipping one would
have handed the attack a supported spelling instead of making it edit the
workflow in ways a reviewer and a required check will notice.

Close that in branch protection, not in this repository's files: make the
dep-guard job a **required status check** on the protected branch, so a
pull request that deletes it cannot merge, or call it through a **reusable
workflow pinned to a ref on a protected branch**, so the pull request's own
copy is not what runs. Pull requests from forks do not have this problem in
the same way, since their workflow changes need approval to run at all.

### Requiring a human approval

Some teams want more than "the base ref decided": they want a person to
have approved a config or baseline change before it takes effect. That is
an add-on, and it belongs in **GitHub branch protection plus a CODEOWNERS
entry** for `.dep-guard.json`, `.dep-guard.local.json` and
`.dep-guard.baseline.json`, so a change to any of them needs a review from
the named owners before it can land on the base branch.

It is deliberately not a setting in `.dep-guard.json`. A mode selector that
lives in the file a pull request controls is a knob a pull request flips to
whichever mode is weaker; base-ref loading is the floor precisely because
it is the one thing a pull request cannot write. An add-on that can only
make the gate stricter is safe to offer, and this one lives where the pull
request cannot reach it.

## SARIF output (`--format sarif`)

```
dep-guard scan --staged --format sarif > dep-guard.sarif
```

Writes SARIF 2.1.0 to stdout and nothing else, so it can be redirected
straight into a file an uploader consumes. Diagnostics go to stderr, the
same split `--format json` uses.

The mapping, which is stable and shared across this family's gates:

| SARIF field | dep-guard value |
|---|---|
| `tool.driver.name` | `dep-guard` |
| `tool.driver.version` | the installed CLI version |
| `result.ruleId` | `dep-guard/<rule-id>` |
| `result.level` | `error` for critical and high, `warning` for medium, `note` for low |
| `properties.severity` | dep-guard's own severity word, unflattened |
| `properties.blocking` | whether this finding blocks at the run's threshold |
| `properties.details` | the finding's `details` bag, verbatim |
| `partialFingerprints["dep-guard/v1"]` | the finding's existing fingerprint, unchanged |
| `locations[].logicalLocations[]` | `kind: package`, `fullyQualifiedName` the package name |
| `locations[].physicalLocation` | the manifest path, relative, under `%SRCROOT%`; omitted for `dep-guard check`, which has no file behind it |

Two of those are worth calling out. `properties.blocking` is dep-guard's
own gate decision rather than something the consumer recomputes from the
level, because SARIF's four levels cannot express a four-severity scale
plus a configurable threshold. And `partialFingerprints` reuses the
fingerprint dep-guard already uses for baselining, so a GitHub alert and
a dep-guard baseline entry track the same finding across commits instead
of drifting apart. No region is emitted: dep-guard does not record which
line of a manifest a dependency sits on, and a guessed line number is
indistinguishable from a real one once uploaded.

## Usage

```
dep-guard scan --staged --corpus-dir <dir>     # what this commit adds
dep-guard scan --base main --corpus-dir <dir>  # what this branch adds
dep-guard scan --corpus-dir <dir>              # audit the whole tree
dep-guard check <name> --corpus-dir <dir>      # is this one safe to add
dep-guard init                                 # install the pre-commit hook

dep-guard scan --base origin/main --trust-base origin/main   # judging a pull request
```

`--trust-base <ref>` is pull-request mode, on both `scan` and `check`: the
config and the baseline come from `<ref>` rather than from the tree being
judged, and a head-side change to either is reported and ignored. It is a
different question from `--base`, which only decides what the change is
compared against. See the pull-request section above.

`--format json` prints a single result object on stdout with diagnostics on
stderr, so a consumer can parse stdout alone. `--format sarif` does the
same with a SARIF 2.1.0 log; `--format text` (the default) is the
human-readable report.

Exit codes are the contract: 0 clean, 1 findings at or above the threshold,
2 something went wrong. A gate that cannot read its own
inputs fails closed rather than reporting clean.

Set the threshold with `--fail-on critical|high|medium|low|none`. Default is
`medium`.

## Configuration

`.dep-guard.json` at the repo root, overlaid by an optional
`.dep-guard.local.json`:

```json
{
  "failOn": "medium",
  "online": false,
  "allow": ["some-package", "@acme/*"],
  "internalScopes": ["@acme"],
  "internalPrefixes": ["acme-"],
  "extraAliases": { "unused-imports": ["eslint-plugin-unused-imports"] },
  "ignorePaths": ["fixtures"]
}
```

Two things worth knowing before you use them. `allow` means "ignore this
package everywhere" -- it silences every rule except lockfile tampering,
which is a fact about where bytes come from rather than about the package.
And `ignorePaths` drops findings before the gate sees them, so a pattern
broad enough to match everything would switch the tool off; patterns made
only of wildcards are rejected for that reason.

Every key here, the baseline file beside it, and the scope pins in
`.npmrc`, are **control inputs**: they decide what dep-guard reports rather
than what dep-guard is looking at. On a pull-request run they are read from
the base ref, not from the branch under judgment, so a pull request cannot
loosen the gate in the commit the gate is weighing. See the pull-request
section above.

## Building a corpus

The corpus is a bloom filter over known npm package names, a popularity
list, and a list of confusion pairs. A freshly built one ships inside the
published core package, so nothing here is required for normal use --
this section is for building your own, either to point `--corpus-dir` at
something newer than the last release's walk or to work on the corpus
machinery itself. `packages/core/fixtures/corpus` holds a small
development corpus useful for tests and useless for real work -- it knows
fifty package names.

The bundled corpus has a cadence, because it decays: every name published
after its walk reads as unknown until the next one. The release workflow
rebuilds it from a live registry walk on every release, and a release
carrying a fresh corpus goes out at least once a month while development is
active, on a minor version as the
[stability policy](docs/release/stability-policy.md) describes. Every scan
records the walk's date as `corpusBuiltAt` in its JSON output, so a scan
against a corpus older than that promise is visible rather than silent.

`scripts/build-corpus.mjs` walks the public registry replica for the names
and reads the popularity list from `scripts/data/top-packages.txt`, which is
checked into this repository rather than fetched. That file is a trust
input: the typosquat rule exempts every name in it, so a name that got onto
it wrongly would have bought immunity. Every name in it exists in a registry
walk this project ran, and cleared a measured floor of ten thousand
downloads in the last week from npm's own downloads API, at the time the
file was built. Its header records both, and
`scripts/refresh-top-list.mjs` is what rebuilds it.

## How it compares

dep-guard is deliberately narrow. It reads manifests and lockfiles at the
moment they change; it does not analyse package contents, mine git history,
or check for known vulnerabilities. Those are other tools' jobs and they do
them well:

| | dep-guard | Socket | Snyk | npq | lockfile-lint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-edit and staged-diff gate | yes | no | no | no | no |
| Hallucinated name detection | yes | partial | no | partial | no |
| Package content analysis | no | yes | no | no | no |
| Known vulnerabilities | no | partial | yes | no | no |
| Interactive install prompt | no | no | no | yes | no |
| Lockfile trust policy | yes | no | no | no | yes |
| Local only, no account | yes | no | no | yes | yes |

Run it alongside them, not instead of them.

## Lockfile support

Coverage is honest per format rather than uniform. Where a format cannot
answer a question, the scan says so in a diagnostic instead of staying
quiet:

- `package-lock.json` v2 and v3 -- full coverage.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` v9+ -- full, except install scripts, which the format
  stopped recording. Additions to `onlyBuiltDependencies` are used instead.
- `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock` -- manifest-level checks only. Neither records
  install scripts, and yarn berry records no resolved URL.
- `bun.lockb` -- skipped. Undocumented binary format.

## Development

Node 22+, pnpm 9+.

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
```

`docs/INVARIANTS.md` records the rules the engine depends on across module
boundaries. Read it before changing the delta, the fingerprint, path
handling, or anything that decides an exit code.
