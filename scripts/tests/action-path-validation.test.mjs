// Self-test for action.yml's input validation, modelled on vault-guard's
// scripts/test-action-path-validation.sh and folded into `pnpm test`
// rather than left as a standalone script, because this repo's rule is
// that `pnpm test` is the single answer to "did I break anything".
//
// The regression it exists for: a bash `=~` pattern written `{1,256}`
// fails to COMPILE on macOS, where the BSD regex engine sets RE_DUP_MAX
// to 255. A pattern that fails to compile does not match, so every path
// input -- including the default `.` -- was rejected as invalid, and the
// action was unusable for anyone on macOS while passing perfectly on the
// ubuntu runners CI actually used. That asymmetry is why a grep guard
// below is worth as much as the behavioural checks: on Linux the broken
// pattern "works", so only reading the file catches it.
//
// Two kinds of assertion live here, and the second is what keeps the
// first honest:
//
//   1. Behavioural: the validate_path logic accepts and rejects the right
//      values, exercised by running it under the real bash.
//   2. Textual: action.yml actually contains the idiom that behaviour was
//      written against, and does not contain the two shapes known to
//      break it. Without these, the behavioural half would keep passing
//      against its own private copy of the function long after action.yml
//      had drifted away from it.
