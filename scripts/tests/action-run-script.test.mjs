//
//   bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}

// That `-e` is the whole point of this file. A review found the step
// opening with `set -uo pipefail`, which ADDS -u and pipefail but does
// nothing to clear the errexit GitHub already turned on. So the moment
// dep-guard exited non-zero -- which is the entire interesting case, a
// scan that found something -- the shell aborted at the npx line and
// never reached `SCAN_STATUS=$?`. GITHUB_OUTPUT was never written, so
// steps.run.outputs.results_file was empty, so the Upload SARIF step had
// nothing to upload and the report step had no exit code to re-raise.
// Findings were silently never uploaded.
//
// No amount of reading action.yml catches that; it needs the script run
// under the right shell flags with a failing stub. Hence this file rather
// than another text guard in action-path-validation.test.mjs.
