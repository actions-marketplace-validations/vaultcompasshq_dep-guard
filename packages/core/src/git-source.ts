 * A cheap, resolver-INDEPENDENT answer to "does anything that looks like a

 * repository that genuinely has none (a real, legitimate state -- stays a
 * clean pass) from one where a manifest sits on disk but the resolver's own
 * rules (workspace globs, the git index for --staged, symlink containment)
 * never reached it (could-not-run instead).
 *
 * Deliberately not a second implementation of the resolver: it does not
 * read a workspaces field or pnpm-workspace.yaml, so it does not know which
 * subdirectories the resolver considers packages, and it does not follow
 * symlinks, so a manifest reachable only through one is invisible here
 * exactly as it is to a plain recursive listing. Both are asymmetric in the
 * safe direction -- a manifest this probe cannot see only ever costs the
 * existing (softer) behaviour, never a wrongful could-not-run, because this
 * function is only ever consulted when the real resolver already found
 * zero.
 *
 * Reads the real filesystem, not whichever git snapshot the scan mode is
 * judging (the index for --staged, a ref for --base). A repository that has
 * a real, on-disk package.json the developer has not yet run `git add` on
 * is exactly the situation this probe is meant to flag as suspicious -- see
 * scan.ts's empty-scan-fail-closed note for the tradeoff this accepts.
