// The three online steps, in the order the run's one wall-clock budget is

//     only one whose absence gets steadily worse as a release ages away
//     from its corpus walk. If the budget only stretches to one step, this
//     is the one worth having.
//  2. typosquat popularity asymmetry, which escalates an existing low.
//  3. registered-squat, which adds a new medium.
//
// Steps 2 and 3 both only ever add or escalate, so a budget spent before
// them costs a signal that would not have existed offline either. Step 1
// is the one whose omission leaves a user with a blocking finding they
// have no way to clear, which is why it goes first.
//
// Never throws, per docs/INVARIANTS.md: each step owns its own error
// handling and turns a failure into a diagnostic, because --online
// reaching a pre-commit hook must not let a flaky connection block a
// commit.
// Existence for the unknown-package check is asked LIVE, never served
// from the shared cache, and the two reasons are independent.
//
// First, the cache cannot answer this question. It stores a `created:`
// date, written for registered-squat's age question, and a date cannot
// tell a real package from an npm security-holding placeholder or from a
// name whose every version has been unpublished. Handing a cache hit to
// this check is handing it a fact about a different question.
//
// Second, even a cache that did store presence would be the wrong input
// here. `created:` entries never expire, so a name that existed when some
// earlier scan asked would read as present forever afterwards on that
// machine -- including a name npm has since removed for security reasons,
// which is the single case where a stale "it exists" is most harmful.
// Standing a blocking finding down, or downgrading it, is the one place
// in this subsystem where a wrong answer costs coverage rather than
// costing an extra signal, so it goes to the network or it leaves the
// finding alone.
//
// The cache stays exactly as valid as it was for registered-squat's age
// question, which is what it was written for: a real creation date does
// not change.
